# 🌿 Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

Welcome to the Leaf Disease Detection project! This project leverages deep learning techniques to identify diseases in plant leaves from images. 🌱✨

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can classify different types of leaf diseases. The dataset contains images of leaves with various diseases, and our goal is to develop a model that can accurately detect these diseases to assist in agricultural management.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is organized into different directories, each containing images of a specific type of leaf disease:

- 🌽 **Corn (Maize) - Common Rust**
- 🥔 **Potato - Early Blight**
- 🍅 **Tomato - Bacterial Spot**

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Image Augmentation**: Enhance model generalization by augmenting the dataset with random transformations.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Build and train a CNN model to classify leaf images into different disease categories.
- **Visualization**: Use Matplotlib to visualize the training process and model performance.
